Select your organization on the drop down list. You might not see your DevOps Organization if you recently linked it to your Azure Active Directory. To work around this issue, close all browser windows and log in again to Azure DevOps, then start again from step 1 above.

After selecting your organization, click "Install" to install the SQL DW extension to Azure DevOps.
